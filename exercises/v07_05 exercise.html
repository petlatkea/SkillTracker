  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Random position (and speed)</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">Expand the CoinClicker mini game with randomness</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps. In previous exercises you added animations, events, and counting points and lives.<br>
    For this version, you are only going to worry about what happens to the coins, bomb, and heart, when they reach the bottom of the screen: they should still start over from the top, but at a different horizontal position.</p>
    <p>Download the zip-file: <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/coinclicker_random_starterfiles.zip" download><code>coinclicker_random.zip</code></a> and unpack it to your exercises folder.</p>
    <p>If you really want to, you can work with your existing files - you only need to edit the CSS: add the nine <code>.position</code> classes, and remember to remove any <code>left:</code> properties from all the containers.</p>
      
  <hr>

  <p>The premise is simple: When any element reaches the bottom of the screen, i.e. when its' animation is about to restart, give it a random position, with one of the position-classes.<br>
  Don't forget to remove all the existing position-classes!</p>
  <p>You are probably going to have to create a separate function for each container on the screen, but start out with one, and see if you can use a similar solution for the rest.</p>

  <p>If you are feeling adventurous, also try to set random speeds on each element!</p>
