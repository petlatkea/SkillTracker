  <h1 class="description">Exercise - CoinClicker game over</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">Expand the CoinClicker mini game with game over</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps. In previous exercises you added animations, events, and counting points and lives.<br>
    
    For this version, you are only going to worry about what happens when too many lives has been lost. When there are no more lives left to lose, the game should be over, and it shouldn't be possible to click anything else.<br>
    Also, the player shouldn't be able to click the heart and gain extra lives, if she already has all hearts full.</p>
    
    <p>Download the zip-file: <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/coinclicker_gameover_starterfiles.zip" download><code>coinclicker_gameover.zip</code></a> and unpack it to your exercises folder.</p>
    <p>This folder includes a basic JavaScript-file that counts lives up and down, when either the heart or bomb is clicked. You can also use your own solution to the Coinclicker Score-exercise, with counting of lives and points.<br>
    There's no animation in this exercise, but feel free to combine it with other exercises, to make an almost complete CoinClicker mini game.</p>
      
  <hr>

  <p>Make a function called <code>gameOver()</code>, and call that function when the player has lost too many lives. The function should disable all clicking, and display a simple "Game Over"-message in the console.<br>
    Also fix the <code>clickHeart()</code> function, so it doesn't add lives beyond the number of hearts.</p>
    <p>Use <code>if</code> statements!</p>
    
  <p><i>You can combine this exercise with <b>CoinClicker random</b> !</i></p>
